# 🐶🐱 Cat and Dog Detection using YOLOv11

This project implements an Object Detection model to identify Cats and Dogs using the **YOLOv11 Nano** architecture (`yolo11n`) by Ultralytics. It includes scripts for training the model on custom data and running inference on images/videos.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies: This project requires Python 3.8+ and the ultralytics package.

```Bash
pip install ultralytics
```

## Usage
### 1. Training (Skippable)
To train the model using the configuration specified in `config.yaml` and the `yolo11n.pt` weights, run `train.py` after having added your local dataset.

The dataset I used to train: `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/dog-and-cat-detection` (The first 70% are used to train, the rest are used for validation)


### 2. Inference (Testing)
To run detection on `test_images.jpg` or `test_video.mp4`, run `test.py`. The results will be automatically saved to runs/detect/predict/.

### 3. Detection Results
Below is the result generated by the model. The bounding boxes indicate detected classes (cat/dog) with their confidence scores.

(Note: This image corresponds to the file located at runs/detect/predict/test_images.jpg generated after running the test script.)
